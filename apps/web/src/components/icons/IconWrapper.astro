/**
 * Icon Wrapper Component
 * 
 * This is a more direct approach to using lucide-astro icons.
 * Import icons directly in your components instead of using the dynamic Icon component.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * ```astro
 * ---
 * import { User, Mail, Phone } from 'lucide-astro'
 * ---
 * 
 * <User size={24} />
 * <Mail size={24} color="#3b82f6" />
 * <Phone size={24} stroke-width={2} />
 * ```
 * 
 * For a dynamic icon system, use the Icon.astro component instead.
